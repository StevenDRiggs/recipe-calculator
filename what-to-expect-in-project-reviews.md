# What To Expect In Your Project Review

## What are Project Reviews for?

Project reviews are focused on preparing you for [technical interviews](https://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/career-path-guides/technology-it-software-development/five-ways-stand-out-your-technology/what-expect-technical-interview/). Treat project reviews as if they were technical interviews in both attitude and technical presentation.

Reviewers will confirm that you've met the technical and complexity requirements for the project and probe your understanding of the concepts to make sure that you are ready to move on to the next section of material.

## What should you be prepared for in Project Review?

During your project review, be prepared to:

1. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. Use the best technical vocabulary you can.
2. Live code. This could be refactoring, adding a new feature, or both.
3. Answer questions about your knowledge of the concepts covered in the curriculum.

## Learning Goals

In each Project Review, there are specific Learning Goals representing the skills and knowledge you should aim to demonstrate. The learning goals for each project are listed in the project instructions.

## What happens if I don't meet the requirements?

If the technical requirements for the project are not met, or if the reviewer finds significant gaps in your understanding, be prepared to do one or all of the following:

- Submit an improved version of your project
- Meet again for another Project Review

## What won't happen

- You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
- You won't be put on the spot without support
- There's nothing you can do to instantly fail or blow it.

Most students and instructors find Project Reviews to be a collaborative, positive experience. You should expect to leave the conversation with clear feedback and next steps for your learning.
