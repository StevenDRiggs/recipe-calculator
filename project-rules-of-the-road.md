# Project Rules of the Road

Flatiron Assessment Philosophy: https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/assessments-introduction

## Rules for you

Your project should be your own. You are allowed to use the internet to reference documentation, get unstuck, or to learn how to do something. Your project is an authentic, real world task - you will be able to search the internet in the real world.

You are not allowed to copy someone else's code and present it as your own. A good rule of thumb: using code packaged as a library is okay, but copying and pasting someone else's code is not. Similarly, you shouldn't have code from another student or from a friend.

### Support

We all get stuck sometimes, and when we're frustrated, it's easy to slip from the mindset 'I want to understand' into 'I want this to work'. This is a natural reaction. You _should_ reach out for help. You _should not_ let someone else solve your issue for you.

If you get help from someone, it should be to help you learn how to fix your issue. If you get something working with help, but you couldn't explain or replicate it yourself, it's not your work! If you find yourself in a situation where you don't understand how some code works, reach out to an instructor for help.

## Tips and guidelines

- Don't copy / paste code
- Know what each line of your code is doing
- If you get stuck, ask for help
